# Canadian Coder
Personal freelance business website created from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. It includes basic form validation with error handling both on the client side (via HTML and CSS) and server side (via PHP) to ensure data integrity and user input validation. This project demonstrates my web development skills and includes my business logo designed using Canva, features articles for content, and utilizes various CSS-based hover effects for enhanced interactivity.
